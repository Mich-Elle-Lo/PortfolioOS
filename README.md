## **About**

This project is my personal portfolio, a space where I showcase my skills, projects, and passions. It's a work in progress, and I'm continuously adding new features, improving the design, and refining the content. While it's not yet complete, I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoy building it!

## **Inspiration**

> _"Creativity is contagious, pass it on."_ ‚Äì Albert Einstein

This project was inspired by another developer who created an impressive Windows 11 clone. Seeing their work reminded me of the power of inspiration in our learning journeys. We grow and innovate by building upon the ideas of others, and this portfolio is my own take on blending design and functionality in a way that reflects my style and interests. It‚Äôs a testament to how creativity flourishes when we are motivated by the incredible work of our peers.

## Tech Stack

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm using to build this portfolio:

- **Next.js:** Powers the site with server-side rendering and static generation for better performance.
- **React:** The backbone for creating the interactive and dynamic user interface.
- **TypeScript:** Keeps the codebase strong and easy to manage with type safety.
- **Chakra UI:** Handles the styling, making sure everything looks good and works well across devices.
- **Framer Motion:** Adds those smooth animations and transitions to bring the UI to life.
- **SCSS:** Helps keep the styles clean and organized with the flexibility of Sass.
