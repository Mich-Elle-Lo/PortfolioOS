## **About**

This project is my personal portfolio, a space where I showcase my skills, projects, and passions. It's a work in progress, and I'm continuously adding new features, improving the design, and refining the content. While it's not yet complete, I hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoy building it!

## **Inspiration**

> _"Creativity is contagious, pass it on."_ – Albert Einstein

This project was inspired by another developer who created an impressive Windows 11 clone. Seeing their work reminded me of the power of inspiration in our learning journeys. We grow and innovate by building upon the ideas of others, and this portfolio is my own take on blending design and functionality in a way that reflects my style and interests. It’s a testament to how creativity flourishes when we are motivated by the incredible work of our peers.
